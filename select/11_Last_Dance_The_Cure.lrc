[01:44.85] I'm so glad you came
[01:46.61] I'm so glad you remembered
[01:50.07] To see how we're ending
[01:52.22] Our last dance together
[01:55.39] Expectant, too punctual
[01:58.03] But prettier than ever
[02:00.42] I really believe that this time it's forever
[02:22.42] 
[02:05.77] But older than me now
[02:08.19] And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
[02:15.90] To hair and contentment
[02:18.71] That hangs in a basement
[02:21.22] A woman now standing
[02:23.72] Where once there was only a girl
[02:39.72] 
[02:46.90] I'm so glad you came
[02:49.19] I'm so glad you remembered
[02:52.16] The walking through walls
[02:54.26] In the heart of December
[02:57.74] The blindness of happiness
[03:00.51] Of falling down laughing
[03:02.97] And I really believed
[03:04.91] That this time was forever
[03:17.91] 
[03:08.42] But Christmas falls late now
[03:10.84] Flatter and colder
[03:13.44] And never as bright
[03:15.61] As when we used to fall
[03:18.45] All this in an instant
[03:20.98] Before I can kiss you
[03:23.63] A woman now standing
[03:26.16] Where once there was only a girl
[03:42.16] 
[03:50.15] I'm so glad you came
[03:51.69] I'm so glad you remembered
[03:54.82] To see how we're ending
[03:57.36] Our last dance together
[04:00.17] Reluctantly, cautiously
[04:03.15] But prettier than ever
[04:05.76] I really believe that this time it's forever
[04:27.76] 
[04:10.60] But Christmas falls late now
[04:13.57] Flatter and colder
[04:16.13] And never as bright
[04:18.90] As when we used to fall
[04:21.37] And even if we drink
[04:23.26] I don't think we would kiss
[04:25.52] In the way that we did
[04:28.50] When the woman was only a girl
