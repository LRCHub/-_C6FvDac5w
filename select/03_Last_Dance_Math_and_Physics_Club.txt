Last dance
I've been saving the last dance
Hoping you'll give me one more chance
To make you fall for me

Been bit by love and now I'm spent
Got me under your grip
You got me tied to a string

Why does it have to be sad?
Now darling don't be mad
Let's put the past behind
And hit the floor before the last dance

Problems
Baby we've had some;
Who hasn't?
Just pull up your shoes and your glasses
Before the moment passes
Let's dance
Let's mess around and let's drink these bottles down
It's our last chance
I've been waiting since the first glass

Why does it have to be sad?
Now darling don't be mad
Let's put the past behind
And hit the floor before the last dance

Why does it have to be sad?
Now darling don't be mad
Let's put the past behind
And hit the floor before the last dance
Before the last dance
Hoping you'll give me one more chance
To make you fall for me
To make you fall for me
To make you fall for me
